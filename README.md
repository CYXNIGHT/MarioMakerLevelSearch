# MarioMakerLevelSearch

This application is used to sniff out level data through the Mario Maker Bookmark website.
It does this by looping through each search value, receiving the html document, and storing the data into level objects.

With the CSV export option, you can easily import the data into an SQL server to perform some complex queries.
I don't what the use of the XML export option is yet, I just did it as an experiment to see if I could do it.

The windows forms version is working 100%, though does require some quality-of-life improvements.
The WPF app doesn't work, as I have not put much time, nor effort, into it.

Feel free to bettererer my code
